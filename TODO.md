### Notes

* Garmin Connect Course API is only available to business devs; so can't fetch previews or basic course data.

### TODOs

* Rework docker container to pick up changes dynamically
* Find out how to read a json file
* Find out proper Weather API calls
  * which weather API to use?
* Check https://github.com/tcgoetz/GarminDB for route data
* Bootstrap for styling
